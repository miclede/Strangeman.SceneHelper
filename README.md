# Strangeman.SceneHelper
[![GitHub package.json version]](#installation)[![ChangelogBadge]](CHANGELOG.md) [![InstallationBadge]](#installation) [![WikiBadge]][WikiLink]

This package provides a data-first Unity Scene loading & transition management solution for Unity.

The package will be updated as I implement new features and fix issues, and create new examples.

Feel free to create your own projects using this as a resource. While it is not required to state that a product / project is using this solution, I would like to shout-out those that do.

## Planned Features
- Create prefabs: Create prefabs for the TimedSceneTransition and LogoLoading load:transition example.
- Mecanim Expansion: Load scenes dynamically from animation states following the load:transition system design.
- Example Scenes: Example scenes with loading and transition visuals.
